Hey there! I’m currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Guang Chen, the head of the [Eobotics & Embodied AI Lab](https://ispc-group.github.io/). My research focuses on **AI for drug design**, with specific interests in (1) structure-based molecular generation, (2) generative models, and (3) transfer learning. Now, I serve as a reviewer for Briefings in Bioinformatics, Journal of Cheminformatics, BioData Mining, BMC Bioinformatics, and others.
