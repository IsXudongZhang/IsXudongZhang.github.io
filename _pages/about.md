Hey there! I’m now a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Guang Chen, the head of the [Embodied Perception and Computing Lab](https://ispc-group.github.io/). My research interests are AI-assisted drug design, including: (1) Structure-based molecular generation. (2) Generative models. (3) Transfer learning.
