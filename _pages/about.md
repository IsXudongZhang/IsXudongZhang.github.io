Hey there! I’m now a a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Guang Chen, the head of the [Embodied Perception and Computing Lab](https://ispc-group.github.io/). My research interests are AI-assisted drug design, including: (1) Structure-based drug design. (2) Generative models. (3) Transfer learning.

Updates
======
**_2023.12_**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m currently summarizing some papers on [Structure-based Molecular Generation](https://github.com/IsXudongZhang/Papers-for-structure-based-molecular-generation).



Publications
======
1. Molormer: a lightweight self-attention-based method focused on spatial structure of molecular graph for drug-drug interactions prediction
2. TransFusionNet: Semantic and Spatial Features Fusion Framework for Liver Tumor and Vessel Segmentation Under JetsonTX2
3. AMDE: a novel attention-mechanism-based multidimensional feature encoder for drug-drug interaction prediction
4. DeepFusion: A Deep Learning Based Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Method for Predicting Drug-Target Interactions

Honors and Awards
======
**_2023.04_** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outstanding Graduate of Shandong Province 

**_2022.12_** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National scholarship for Postgraduates
