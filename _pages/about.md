Hey there! I’m now a a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Guang Chen, the head of the Embodied Perception and Computing Lab. My research interests are AI-assisted drug design, including: (1) Structure-based drug design. (2) Generative models. (3) Transfer learning.

Here, I’ll share my latest work, achievements, and updates in the field.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
