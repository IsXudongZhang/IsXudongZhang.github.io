Hey there! I’m now a a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Guang Chen, the head of the [Embodied Perception and Computing Lab](https://ispc-group.github.io/). My research interests are AI-assisted drug design, including: (1) Structure-based drug design. (2) Generative models. (3) Transfer learning.

Updates
======
**_2023.12_**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m currently summarizing some papers on [Structure-based Molecular Generation](https://github.com/IsXudongZhang/Papers-for-structure-based-molecular-generation)



Publications
======
1. Molormer: a lightweight self-attention-based method focused on spatial structure of molecular graph for drug-drug interactions prediction
2. TransFusionNet: Semantic and Spatial Features Fusion Framework for Liver Tumor and Vessel Segmentation Under JetsonTX2
3. AMDE: a novel attention-mechanism-based multidimensional feature encoder for drug-drug interaction prediction
4. DeepFusion: A Deep Learning Based Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Method for Predicting Drug-Target Interactions

Honors and Awards

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
