Hey there! I’m currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Guang Chen, the head of the [Eobotics & Embodied AI Lab](https://ispc-group.github.io/). My research focuses on **AI for drug discovery**, with specific interests in (1) structure-based molecular generation, (2) generative models, and (3) reinforcement learning.

     We propose AMG, a framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning as a pocket-ligand interaction agent to gradually steer fragment-based 3D molecular generation targeting protein pockets. AMG is trained using a two-stage strategy to capture interaction features and explicitly optimize the interaction agent. The framework also introduces a pair of separate encoders for pockets and ligands, coupled with a dedicated pre-training strategy. This enables AMG to enhance its generalization ability by leveraging a vast repository of undocked pockets and molecules, thus mitigating the constraints posed by the limited quantity and quality of available datasets.
